# CV-controlled-mini-servo-arm
Controlling a small desktop robot arm using a raspberry pi and computer vision to track a human's arm movements

## V3.0 (Future)
Articulated Arm that tracks the angle of the wrist through MediaPipe and uses motors with encoders.

### Current Objectives
- Researching best motors to use
 
## V2.0 (In-Progress)
PUMA Arm with servos that integrates with MediaPipe to detect hand motion to open and close gripper

### Current Objectives
- Researching best motors to use
- Researching different microcontrollers
- Printing [Pre-Designed Arm](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1838120) from thingiverse to develop controls for

### Learning Objectives
- Maybe RTOS?

## V1.0 (Abandoned)
[Initial model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6313449) printed from thingiverse - assembled with servos. 
### Successes
- Articulated via Raspberry Pi
- Utilizing MediaPipe Library for generalized hand detection via build-in PC camera

### Issues Encountered
- Prints and screw sizing were not optimized for assembly
- Servo failing to carry weight and dislodging from part
